            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am in the <em>first year at Algonquin College</em> studying Interactive Media Design (IMD). This is
                the fourth term in the program as we started on May 10<sup>th</sup>, 2021. I have some experience in IT
                project management and I studied cybersecurity. I love solving and troubleshooting issues and I like
                working on Linux commands. I am enthusiastic to learn to code and be able to offer my service to the
                public.
            </p>

                <cite>- Malcolm X .</cite> I find myself inspired by this beautiful quote as it encourages me to start
                learning new things always.

                <h3>My Goal</h3>
                <p>
                    I aim to acquire in-demand skills in the field of <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>
                    which will help me start a new career in this very dynamic field. The age of technology and science,
                    we live in, made it mandatory to have the information presented neatly and efficiently. That is my
                    target, to contribute to building strong and presentable websites, making films, and creating phone
                    applications. Â
